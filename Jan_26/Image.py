# Images
# For the next weeks, we'll focus on an important area of computer science called image processing

''' What is an image? '''
''' You are probably accustomed to working with .jpg, .gif, .png, and
other types of image on your computer'''

''' How do computers store the data that make up an image? It's represented as a 2D
regular grid of pixel values'''
'''We'll say that there are x columns and y rows'''

'''Recall that Python 'counts' starting at 0 and goes to n-1. So the pixel numbering in
the grid go from (0,0) on the top-left corner to (X-1, Y-1) on the bottom right corner,
where again X is the image width in pixels and Y is the image height in pixels (X columns =
width, Y rows = height). This seemingly strangle coordinate system is common to images and
computer graphics'''
